# Adshield
## Abstract:
Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are essential hubs for advertisements, influencing billions
of users daily. However, this ecosystem is also exploited by cyber scammers, resulting in financial and psychological
harm to users. This project proposes a robust, automated system to collect, analyze, and flag potentially harmful
advertisements in real-time, leveraging cutting-edge technologies in data collection, machine learning, and natural
language processing (NLP).

## Objectives:
1. Ad Collection: Use APIs, web scraping, and browser extensions to gather advertisements and associated
metadata such as demographics, engagement metrics, and targeting criteria.
3. Data Preprocessing: Employ tools like MongoDB and PostgreSQL for structured storage and remove
duplicates or irrelevant data to ensure clean datasets.
4. Scam Detection: Develop machine learning models using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and neural
networks to detect patterns indicative of scams in ads.
5. User Profiling: Apply clustering algorithms and NLP (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to understand user behavior,
flag vulnerabilities, and predict susceptibility to scams.
6. Real-Time Alerting: Implement real-time notifications using WebSockets, Kafka, or RabbitMQ to warn users
about flagged ads and notify platforms for moderation.

## üîç Features
- **Social Media Scraping**: Collects user data from Instagram and Facebook.
- **Scam Detection**: Uses BERT-based NLP models for text analysis.
- **User Profiling**: Clusters users based on scam exposure.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Includes Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and deep learning models.
- **Evaluation & Testing**: Model performance analysis with `model_eval.py`.
